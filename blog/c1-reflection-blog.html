        <h1>Reflection</h1>
          <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
            <p>I think it is going to be quite the opposite of your standard university learning (Shereef's 'Restaurant' vs 'Kitchen' example). 
               It won't be about sitting in lectures making notes, this instead will be all about <b>doing</b>. There also seems to be equal emphasis 
               on technical skills and soft skills. From what I've seen so far on Slack etc, people are very open about their progress and personal 
               circumstances, which to me is quite different from what I experience out there in my working life. Something that I will need to get 
               used to.</p>
          <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
            <p>That this is going to be a lot of hard work! Every interaction with EDA so far has at some stage made it very clear that this course 
               will be all consuming, so this is something that I am preparing for. I am going to attempt to become very good with time management 
               and apply as much focus as possible to time spent on EDA (and maybe there will still be some time to do sports every now and 
               then!?)</p>
          <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
            <p>Being open for new ideas and learning and in general just trying to be a good person. Ask for help when I need it, give help when I 
              can.</p>
          <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? Is so, how?</h2>
            <p>Not at all. I've researched EDA quite well, viewed a lot of their videos, read the website, asked around about it and when I thought
               it was what I needed, I met with Jack and had all my questions answered.</p>
          <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
            <p>Yes very much so, I've tried to do the solo learning and have found it didn't work so well for me. This is only sprint 1 and I am 
              already able to focus much more, just because it is not so cut and dry as an online javascript course.</p>
