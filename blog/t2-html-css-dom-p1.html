                    <h5>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you 
                      describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">If you were to think of a bicycle being a website, then HTML are all the 
                      components of the bike; the frame, wheels, handlebars and seat. CSS is 
                      giving these components their visual specifics; colour of the frame, width
                      of the handlebars, height and padding of the seat. The DOM is how the 
                      browser interprets the website (it is not directly created by a person, 
                      as opposed to HTML and CSS), sticking with the bicycle, it will see the 
                      bike as a set of structered components. The top level would be the bike as 
                      a whole, underneath that you have the frame, the next level down could be 
                      components that attach to the frame, like the handlebar. Going even further
                      to fourth level you have objects attaching to the handlebar, like brake 
                      levers and a bell.</p>
                    <h5>What is meant by boxifying design?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      Looking at a design and identifying how the design can be partitioned in 
                      squares. These squares can then be developed with HTML and separately 
                      styled with CSS.</p>
                    <h5>What is the box model?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      CSS uses boxes that wrap around HTML elements so that these elements can 
                      be configured with padding, borders and margin. </p>
