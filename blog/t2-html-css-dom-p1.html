        <h1>Technical Blog Part 1</h1>
          <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you 
              describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
            <p>If you were to think of a bicycle being a website, then HTML are all the 
                components of the bike; the frame, wheels, handlebars and seat. CSS is 
                giving these components their visual specifics; colour of the frame, width
                of the handlebars, height and padding of the seat. The DOM is how the 
                browser interprets the website (it is not directly created by a person, 
                as opposed to HTML and CSS), sticking with the bicycle, it will see the 
                bike as a set of structered components. The top level would be the bike as 
                a whole, underneath that you have the frame, the next level down could be 
                components that attach to the frame, like the handlebar. Going even further
                to fourth level you have objects attaching to the handlebar, like brake 
                levers and a bell.

          <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
            <p>Looking at a design and identifying how the design can be partitioned in 
                squares. These squares can then be developed with HTML and separately 
                styled with CSS.
            </p>
          <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
            <p>CSS uses boxes that wrap around HTML elements so that these elements can 
                be configured with padding, borders and margin.
