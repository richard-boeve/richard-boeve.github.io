          <h2>What is grid based design?</h2>
            <p>You take a design given to you (or think of a page you want to make) and divide it in a grid with vertical and horizontal lines where 
              possible, so that elements on your page fit into the boxes created by the lines. Setting this grid up is part CSS and part HTML.
              CSS will define what a row and column look like with regards to their width (in percentages). HTML will refer to these colums and build
              up the structure and place the content in them. The advantage of grid based design as opposed to using plain HTML to do this is that 
              the page will be more flexible in the layout, both in styling and in responsiveness. 
            </p>
          <h2>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h2>
            <p>People are using devices with all sorts of different screens and resolutions. It is important to give all these users a good experience
              so your page needs to function well for people who use large high resolution screens and for those who are on old smartphones with a very
              limited resolution. A responsive webpage wil scale the page to fit the screen and resolution of all these different users.
            </p>
          <h2>What is semantic structure?</h2>
            <p>The semantic structure of a page is how the tags in a page are laid out and how they are named. It is important to have parents elements
              and then indented child elements underneath it. Semantic naming of the elements means that you describe what the element is, without going
              into how it works. So don't use a lot of 'div' elements when a simple 'h1' would do the job. When you do use 'div', give it a class that
              describes what it does, for example 'col-1' or 'footer'.
            </p>
          <h2>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h2>
            <p>The introduction to bootstrap was very interesting. I have heard the term before without having any idea of what it was. I like that we 
              first get to build a page without bootstrap so we get some HTML/CSS experience starting a page from scratch before we use already set up
              frameworks to build our page on top. It will be interesting to learn more about how bootstrap and a customised CSS work together to get
              the design you want.
