                    <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      It made me more mindfull about how much time I spent on getting design and layout right. I spent too much time on 
                      sprint 2, which was a good learning experience, but maybe not best use of time. In sprint 3 I still spent a lot of time on getting the Skeleton framework and responsiveness to work properly, but less time on small detail.</p>
                    <h5>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      Quite a lot. I've tried various things over the years; Art of Living, Sri Chimnoy, Headspace app. But I have never been able to make it stick, which is a shame as I definitly see the benefits when I do it for a while. So why is it so hard to persist and be disciplined in it?!</p>
                    <h5> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      Mostly a reminder that it is normal to lose attention during meditation and that this is ok as when you bring the attention back, that is the trigger that makes you improve. So I'll still try to focus, but when the mind wonders, be more kind to myself and bring it back gently while thinking about those brain gains I am making.</p>
                    <h5>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      I liked the suggestions about the positions to be in, realising I might have been in slouch mode to often. I'll also try to apply the eyes half open method.</p>
                    <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
                      <p class="plain-content">
                      Time to Github this blog and do my meditation!</p>
