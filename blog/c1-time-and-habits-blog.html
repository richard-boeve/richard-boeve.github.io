        <h1>Time and Habits</h1>
          <h2>Which timebox and habits technique did you try?</h2>
            <p>To be expanded on when I have had a chance to try some. I do meditate (but not often enough, clearly not a strong habit...yet!).</p>
          <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
            <p>A couple things, I find BJ Foggs explanation of how to anchor new habits after habits you already have a very good idea. 
              The Pomodoro technique I would like to try as well. And maybe I can make meditation a habit using this anchoring technique!?</p>
          <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
            <p>TBD</p>
          <h2>Which will you experiment with further?</h2>
            <p>Creating good habits and the pomodoro technique. Make meditatian a daily habit, using Headspace.</p>
