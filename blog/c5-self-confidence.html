                    <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and awareness?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">They are very closely linked. Awareness is sort of stepping back and witnessing your emotions with the thinking part of your brain. When you do that, you most probably take better and different actions that result form your emotions. Mindfullness is purposely paying attention to what is going on in your head and body, which means you are 'aware', hence the close link to awareness or even interchangeability of the two. </p>
                    <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body scan, Journalling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">I tried the body scan as per chapter 4 and have also done bodyscans using the Headspace app. I always struggle with it, even more than with meditation. This time I felt no emotions as such coming to me, I think I was too much focused on what I was feeling in the body parts I was scanning. Did figure out that my neck might be tad tight, so will spend some time on releasing these muscles today (Kelly Starrett/MobilityWOD and Trevor Bachmeyer/Smashwerx are the best if you need any help with tight muscles or niggles, both on Youtube). </p>
                    <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>   
                        <p class="plain-content">There are three 'levels' in which you can experiece emotions. The first most basic form is where you identify with the emotion ("I am {emotion}"}. The second one is where you are stepping back from emotions and see them as ("I feel {emotion}"). The third one, the optimum way is to see them as ("I experience {emotion} in my body"). I think the second level should be achievable (and very benificial) if you apply a lot of mindfulness to your emotions. The stronger the emotion the harder this will be, but maybe I can try to apply it to 'smaller' emotions and train myself.</p>
