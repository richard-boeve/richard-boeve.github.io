                    <h5>What is a responsive site and why is it important?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    A responsive site caters to visitors with all sorts of different devices and screen resolutions. It will display the website
                    properly on larger screens and on smaller screens. This is important as there is an ever growing variety of screen resolutions. Some people have massive high resolution displays on which they view websites, others will have an old smartphone with a low resolution, yet the website should look good on either. </p>
                    <h5>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    Mobile first design means that the design for the most difficult screen resolutions is done first. Lower resolutions are harder to design for, but when that is done successfully, then the mobile design can be expanded on for the larger resolutions. </p>
                    <h5>What is framework and what are their pros and cons?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    A framework is a bit like a template. By using a framework you don't have to re-invent the wheel each and every time you build a website. It allows code to be re-used and minimises overhead, which mean faster and easier web development. Cons are it can be limited, you might not be able to exactly do what you want. Another negative is that when you are learning and you use frameworks, you might actually not learn how to develop some functionality as it is already done for you by the framework.</p>
                    <h5>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    A wireframe is a symplistic sketch of a website that shows the main elements. The wireframe is created by a designer and after approval from the business/customer the developer can use it as a starting off point for website development.</p>
                    <h5>What aspects of my wireframes where difficult to implement and why?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    Main struggles were around alignment and spacing. The div's have a space between them, so it was hard to have elements in different div's sit flush against eachother. In the end I solved that by using negative margins. The one thing I couldn't do was the hamburger menu for mobile, but that is probably done by javascript in a following sprint.</p>
