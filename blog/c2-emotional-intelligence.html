    <h1>C2 Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <h2>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>
            <p>
                That your amount of emotional intelligence is not set in stone, it is something that you can train and expand. Meng's method to expand your emotional intelligence starts with a 2 minute per day mindfulness session to train the mind in quality attention. Looking forward to read the remainder of the book.

        <h2>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>
                 Haven't tried it yet, so will come back to this. I've been meditating 10 minutes every day with the Headspace app though, which has mindfullness aspects to it and I do find it a struggle to focus sometimes. Practice makes perfect I hope!?
