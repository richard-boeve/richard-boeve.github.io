                    <h5>What was the problem?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">The problem that seems to get me most often is knowing what I want to code in Javascript, but not knowing how to do it in such a way that it works.</p>
                    <h5>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">I retrace my steps. Often we would have learned about the principle in either this sprint or a previous sprint. Of course the examples used never match the problem I am trying to solve! At that point I try to google and see if I can find any tips. When I really can't figure it out I look at the answer. When I do, I analyse the answer until I understand what the approach was.</p>
                    <h5>How did you feel throughout the process?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">Sometimes a little frustrated, but it is very satisfying when you do solve something that got you stuck for a while.</p>
                    <h5>What did you learn?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">- Before Phase 0 I didn't know what I didn't know. Now I know what I don't know (and it's a lot). <br>
                        - Using google to find an answer requires skill. Often the results coming back are too difficult or just don't apply. Thinking about how to phrase you search term is an art.<br>
                        - I like the Eloquent Javascript book and am going to buy that so I can keep it handy for referencing it.  <br>
                        - I often think too difficult, start simple then expand.</p>
