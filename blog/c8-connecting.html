                    <p class="plain-content">A few years ago the manager of the team I worked in left and I stepped up to take his place. Having first been part of the team and now having to lead my colleagues would be difficult if they wouldn't accept me. Since I already was part of that team for a while I knew what the issues were and tried to make the situation better for everyone, this helped gain trust. Other things I tried was to give the people in the team ownership of a piece of work and I often let them choose what they wanted to pick up. Always backing the team and never taking personal credit for work the team did helped a lot as well. We are now years further and are all working on different contracts, yet we still maintain a good relationship.</p>

                    <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">The better you know people the harder it is to listen emphatically without also psycholising the conversation a bit. I think this is because you know them better, their past, what they are like and what motivates them. The book mentions you can listen emphatically and still disagree, but it didn't explain how to the proceed after you have listened emphatically (instead moves on to less personal organisational change). I think emphatically listening is very important, but there also needs to be a chance for the listener to disagree and voice that with integrity and kindness (assuming it is a conversation and not a monologue) without it being called psycholising. Overall though, I really think that emphatically listening without judgement is one of the best skills to have to better relationship with your fellow humans.

                    Vendor decides to not provide release notes anymore when delivering new functionality, which I didn't agree with.<br><br>
                    <b>Why I am 100% correct and reasonable:</b><br><br>
                    Getting release notes with new software is an agreed process. There was no consultation in changing that process. I provided three valid reasons as to why I need release notes.<br><br>
                    <b>Why the vendor was 100% correct and reasonable:</b><br><br>
                    The customer is keeping us to our development timelines and we can't meet these so we have to cut the least essential processes down to a minimum, which unfortuntaly includes documentation of the software we deliver.</p>
