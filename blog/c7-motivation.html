                    <h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">Pretty good. This chapter really resonated most with me out of the chapters I have read so far. I think the world at the moment is really geared towards 'pleasure'. Social media portrays all those happy people (but are they?) and instant gratification is key. I've been working on the 'purpose' part for a year now and that has been hard and great at the same time. I've had a couple false starts. Luckily I have had help from my patient partner and a couple of friends, one of them is a coach and mixes that with personal branding. I've sort of re-designed the way I want my career to move forward (hello EDA!) and it has given me a greater sense of purpose, which makes me a happier person. I also quit all social media, except for LinkedIn, and don't miss it a bit. Pleasure for me comes in the form of watching sports, training together, a walk on the beach or just hanging out at home with the GF and our feline boys.</p>
                    <h5>What are your core values, what do you stand for?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">A friend of mine did my personal branding and build a website for me earlier this year. Included in this was a coaching part and figuring out what my core values are so that could be reflected in the website. I went through several exercises which concluded in the following core values: Integrity, Reliability, Emphaty, Fairness and Freedom. These are all things that are very important to me and values I try to uphold.</p>
                    <h5>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercises?</h5>
                        <p class="plain-content">Very interesting reading about the negative experiental bias as I didn't know that existed. Definitly something to keep in mind and try to see things in perspective. It all seems to come down to being more consciously aware of failure/disappointment and seeing it in perspective, but also doing the same for achievements and celebrate these.</p>
