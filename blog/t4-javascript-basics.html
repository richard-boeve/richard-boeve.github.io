                    <h5>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">Javascript is very different from HMTL and CSS. Each of these three have their own part to play when creating a website. Javascript is used to create the interactive elements of a website, whereas HTML and CSS are more static. HTML defines the structure and CSS defines the design, the looks.</p>

                    <p class="plain-content">
                    Control flow means that code is run from the beginnning to the end UNLESS a condition or a loop is encountered which will instruct otherwise. Applied to the process of 'waking up' you could have the alarm going off, switching off the alarm and getting up, which means the full code has been run. But it is also possible to build in a condition where the alarm is switched off, but you are not getting up, instead sleeping further. If that scenario happens, not all code is run (ie the 'getting up' part isn't), but the code has still run correctly.</p>

                    <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    The difference is that with data in an object, you can use a string to access the data within the object, but with array you have to use a numeric key. Exampe of the same information stored in an array and a non-array object:<br>
                    Array: var pets = ["cat", "dog", "goldfish"]<br>
                    Object: var pets = {pet1: cat, pet2: dog, pet3: goldfish}<br>
                    Accessing the data in the array is done by using an index in brackets: "pets[2]" which will return "Goldfish" as we start counting at zero.
                    Accessing the data in the object using the string: "pets.pet2" which will return "dog".</p>

                    <h5>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
                    <p class="plain-content">
                    A function is a contained piece of code that performs a particular task. They are useful, because once a function is written, it is reusable, it can be called again and again without having to re-write the same code multiple times at various locations. </p>
